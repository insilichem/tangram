Automatic bond order perception for UCSF Chimera [WIP]

Features
========

While UCSF Chimera does have some kind of bond order perception that supports its internal atom typing engine (see `[Chimera-users] bond order`_), this information is not available to the user (not even in the Python API). This extension tries to fill the gap by providing a graphic interface to perceive bond order with external programs and/or set them manually.

Usage
=====

[WIP]

This extension is still under development. Documentation will be ready once basic functionality is achieved.

Requirements
============

- ``libplume`` (*pip*-installable)
